## Install

### Composer (preferred)

Add `"dereuromark/cakephp-databaselog": "dev-master"` and run `composer install`.

###  Manually

Clone the repository into your `app/Plugin/DatabaseLog` directory:

	$ git clone git://github.com/dereuromark/CakePHP-DatabaseLog.git app/Plugin/DatabaseLog

## Setup

Run the schema into your database:

	$ cake schema create --plugin DatabaseLog

Create a config file in `app/Config/database_log.php` with the following (example file in plugin):
```php
$config = array(
	'DatabaseLog' => array(
		'write' => 'default', // DataSource to write to.
		'read' => 'default', // DataSource to read from.
	)
);
```

Pro Tip: You can read from a different datasource than you write to, and they both can be different than your default.

Update the file `app/Config/bootstrap.php` with the following configuration:
```php
App::uses('CakeLog', 'Log');
CakeLog::config('default', array('engine' => 'DatabaseLog.DatabaseLog'));
```

Note that 2.4 drops the suffix, so for all those who use the newest version of cake, its just `Database`:
```php
CakeLog::config('default', array('engine' => 'DatabaseLog.Database'));
```
## Usage

Anywhere in your app where you call log() or CakeLog::write the DatabaseLog engine will be used.
```php
$this->log('This is a detailed message logged to the database', 'error');
// or
CakeLog::write('error', 'This is a detailed message logged to the database');
```

Navigate to `http://www.example.com/admin/database_log/logs` to view/search/delete your logs.

You can customize the template with a custom theme if necessary.
